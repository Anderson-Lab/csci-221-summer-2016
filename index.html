<a id="lecture-style" class="anchor" href="#lecture-style" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lecture Style</h3>

<p>Lecturing about programming is like teaching someone how to swim by talking about swimming. Interesting, but not very helpful. This class has been designed with this in mind. We will be using a flipped classroom, where students are expected to listen to pre-recorded lectures outside of class. These are tightly integrated with the smaller programming assignments. We will discuss the problems themselves in class when appropriate. More importantly, most of our class time will be spent developing a "large" software project from scratch. The software we develop as a class is to serve as a template for your own large software project.</p>

<h3>
<a id="midterm-and-final" class="anchor" href="#midterm-and-final" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Midterm and Final</h3>

<p>There will be one midterm covering approximately half of the material. The final exam will be cumulative. The scheduled final exam time is Tuesday, December 15th (8 AM - 11 AM). This will be used for final project presentations. The final exam will be administered on the last day of class.</p>

<h3>
<a id="programming-assignments" class="anchor" href="#programming-assignments" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming Assignments</h3>

<p>Programming is all about practice. Recently there has been a lot of great online tools built for building up the muscle memory it takes to program. For this course, we will be using Udacity to supplement what we discuss on work on in class. Udacity has 9 problem sets. For each or the 9 problem sets, there will be a dropbox entry in Oaks. You must perform both the draft problem set and the final set to receive full credit. Upload a copy of your progress page (as an image) showing the percentage completed on the section.</p>

<p>There will also be a handful of traditionally graded assignments throughout the semester. The grading of these will focus on more subjective skill development, such as style and commenting.</p>

<h3>
<a id="lessons" class="anchor" href="#lessons" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lessons</h3>

<p>Udacity also has questions embedded in the lesson section. Upload a copy of your progress page (as an image) showing the percentage complete on the section.</p>

<h3>
<a id="programming-project" class="anchor" href="#programming-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming Project</h3>

<p>Each student will choose a semester long project consisting of 7-12 classes. You will be required to implement this project over the semester and present 3 times:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1st Presentation (3-5 Minutes) – Show the class your class model design and implementation</p></li>
<li><p>Presentation Date: September 22nd and 24th</p></li>
<li>Presentation Schedule: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jrmpindcalwsdbl/FirstPresentationSchedule.xlsx?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/jrmpindcalwsdbl/FirstPresentationSchedule.xlsx?dl=0</a>
</li>
<li><p>Prepare a 3 minute presentation (2 minutes for questions) that covers your project idea, presents your class model, two use cases, and your class scaffold implementation</p></li>
<li><p>UML and Use Cases</p></li>
<li><a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/90-754/umlucdfaq.html">https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/90-754/umlucdfaq.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/umlClassDiagrams.pdf">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/umlClassDiagrams.pdf</a></li>
<li>Use Visual Paradigm to diagram to create your model (<a href="http://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/">http://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/</a>).</li>
<li>See the Facebook page for the education key, and make sure to use your .edu address &lt;- very important.</li>
<li>Again, you will need to present (very briefly)</li>
<li>Class Model with at least 7 classes. You must use at least once composition, aggregation, and inheritance.</li>
<li>Use Cases</li>
<li>Scaffold Implementation (blank classes showing inheritance and aggregation)</li>
</ul>

<p>– 2nd Presentation (3 Minutes) – Show the class your implementation with console IO</p>

<ul>
<li>Presentation Date: Nov 3rd and 5th</li>
<li>Presentation Schedule: TBA</li>
<li>Prepare a 2 minute video that demonstrates your working command line (console) prototype.</li>
<li>It must have at least 90% functionality.</li>
<li><p>Video must be uploaded to YouTube, and a link to your presentation must be uploaded to the dropbox in OAKS.</p></li>
<li><p>Part 3 and Final Submission Details</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See Google presentation slides for more information</p>

<p>– Final Presentation (5 Minutes) – Show the class your GUI Implementation</p>

<p>See Google presentation slides for more information</p>

<p>Your project will need to receive input of the data for your classes and persist the data to disk so it can be read back on the next execution of your application. Your final project will be graded on the mastery of the individual course (learning) outcomes. Each of these will be scored from a level of 0 to 10. More details will be given throughout the semester.</p>

<h3>
<a id="honor-code" class="anchor" href="#honor-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Code</h3>

<p>You must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).
You must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.
In any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.
Also see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.
Classroom Policies</p>

<p>You are expected to take good notes during class.
You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.
You are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (&gt;= 3) absences. If you miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office; also, you are responsible for announcements made in class, assignment due dates, etc.
You should turn off all electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, pagers, etc.).
In summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).
Late Policy</p>

<p>No late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.</p>

The Anderson Data Science Research Lab specializes in applying data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, and metabolomics. We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.
