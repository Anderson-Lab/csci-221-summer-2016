<a id="course-learning-outcomes" class="anchor" href="#course-learning-outcomes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course (learning) outcomes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Apply the software development process in problem solving. Specifically, focus on
coding to a specification (including pre- and post-conditions), using pseudo-code, test
driven development, range and boundary checking, and unit testing. [3].</li>
<li>Learn Java syntax. This includes constants and variables, assignment, arithmetic
operations, relational operators, logical operators (including short–circuit), selection
statements, repetition statements, and data types (i.e. reference, primitive) and
primitive wrapper classes [2].</li>
<li>Code solutions that use IO operations. This includes reading/writing text from
standard IO, reading/writing structured data (e.g. csv or imaging data) from a file [3].</li>
<li>Store and manipulate data using one- and two-dimensional arrays. This includes
iteration and common tasks such as finding max/min, summing, making copies
(shallow and deep copy operations) and other aggregate operations [3].</li>
<li>Design classes and apply them in program development. This includes object
instantiation, methods (e.g. constructors, getters, setters, helpers), overloading and
overriding (e.g toString, equals), static versus non–static methods/variables, access
qualifiers (public, protected, private), and “this” reference [4].</li>
<li>Apply object-oriented design principles in program development. This includes
inheritance (abstract classes and interfaces, is-a relationships), composition (has-a
relationship) and class hierarchies [4]. Identify scenarios in which inheritance or
composition is appropriate [5].</li>
<li>Apply exceptions in program development. This includes defining exception classes
using inheritance, 'throws' and 'try/catch' syntax, and understanding the difference
between checked and un-check exceptions [3].</li>
<li>Analyze recursive algorithms (such as factorial, fibonacci, list length, and binary
search) and explain/trace using a stack data structure [4].</li>
<li>Code a dynamic array-based collection (such as an ArrayList, OrderedList,
PriorityQueue,). This includes implementing an interface, managing both size and
capacity, and traversal via an iterator [4].</li>
<li>Code a multi-class project/application that applies the OOD principles covered in this
class. (Multi-class is defined as a minimum of 4 classes.) [4]</li>
</ul>

<a id="grading-policy" class="anchor" href="#grading-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading Policy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Exams - 50%</li>
<li>Programming Assignments - 50%</li>
</ul>

<p>Grading Scale: A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: &lt;65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<p>Grading Guidelines: Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy and reference below).</p>

<ul>
<li>The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.</li>
<li>The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and medium-level achievement in the other.</li>
<li>The grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and medium-level achievement in the others.</li>
<li>The grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.</li>
</ul>

<a id="lecture-style" class="anchor" href="#lecture-style" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lecture Style</h3>

<p>Lecturing about programming is like teaching someone how to swim by talking about swimming. Interesting, but not very helpful. This class has been designed with this in mind. We will discuss core concepts in class, and then use the remaining time as a lab to work on programming assignments, which will then turn into homework if not completed. </p>

<h3>
<a id="exams" class="anchor" href="#exams" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exams</h3>

<p>Exams will be administered every Friday.</p>

<h3>
<a id="programming-assignments" class="anchor" href="#programming-assignments" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming Assignments</h3>

<p>Programming is all about practice. Approximately, every other day there will be programming assignments due.</p>

<h3>
<a id="honor-code" class="anchor" href="#honor-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Code</h3>

<p>You must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).
You must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.
In any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.
Also see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.
Classroom Policies</p>

<p>You are expected to take good notes during class.
You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.
You are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (&gt;= 3) absences. If you miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office; also, you are responsible for announcements made in class, assignment due dates, etc.
You should turn off all electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, pagers, etc.).
In summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).
Late Policy</p>

<p>No late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.</p>

<a id="typical-weekly-schedule" class="anchor" href="#typical-weekly-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Typical weekly schedule</h1>

<li>Monday - Lecture</li>
<li>Tuesday - Lab Day</li>
<li>Wednesday - Lecture</li>
<li>Thursday - Lab Day</li>
<li>Friday - Exam Day</li>
</ul>

<p>Because this is summer, and we are going to move fast. That honestly means that every day, you'll probably end up working on this class in some way. I won't be posting a schedule ahead of time, but I will post a brief overview of the chapters that were covered on what day on this page.</p>

The Anderson Data Science Research Lab specializes in applying data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, and metabolomics. We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.
